# Mission_to_Mars

For this project we used html, python and jupyter notebook to scrape data from specific websites and compile that data into a new website for easy readability and access. We grabbed data from a specific mars website collecting facts and photos and used this to create a nice wesbite that only contained the images and information we wanted from the website.
